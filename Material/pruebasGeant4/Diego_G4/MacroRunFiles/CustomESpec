# Macro file for example

# To be run preferably in batch, without graphics:
# % exampleB4[a,b,c,d] run2.mac
#
#/run/numberOfWorkers 4


# Initializes the run and sets verbosity settings
/run/initialize


# Sets Particle type
/gps/particle e-


# Sets the beam type
# could also be Beam, Point, etc.
/gps/pos/type Beam


# The position of the beam and its rotation.
/gps/pos/centre 0. 0. -50. cm
/gps/pos/rot1 1 0 0 
/gps/pos/rot2 0 1 0

# We have the beam go in the +Z direction
/gps/direction 0 0 1

# Set the size of the beam, since we don't want a pencil beam
#/gps/pos/sigma_r 1 mm

# recall that the people who wrote this make things backwards. I.e, to get a particle traveling in the positive z direction you need theta = 180. So, we have to rotate the axis. These need not be unit vectors
